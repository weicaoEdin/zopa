RateCaculateSystem

How to run:
excute the from command line : java -jar RateCaculateSystem.jar [request amount]
The command line take 1 number parameter request amount, for example:
java -jar RateCaculateSystem.jar 500

method to calculate loan:

using following formula to calculate monthlyPayment, this fomula is from wiki :
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_calculator
singlePayment1 = principal*(effectiveRate+effectiveRate/(Math.pow(1+effectiveRate,numberOfPayments)-1));


I cannot find a way to pass the test in the document, which is

Requested amount: £1000
Rate: 7.0%
Monthly repayment: £30.78
Total repayment: £1108.10

the nearest result is 30.88, which is same from some online calculator.

I cannot figure out how to normalise the different rate to one rate, in this case, I print all the different rate on which
borrowed.
